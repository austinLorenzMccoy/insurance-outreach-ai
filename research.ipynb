    "Problem: Cold emails and cold calls often suffer from low engagement rates because they lack personalization. A generic approach fails to resonate with different prospects. Prospects from different industries have unique concerns, and manual segmentation is slow, making it hard to scale outreach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: Develop an AI-driven cold email workflow for an insurance company that dynamically personalizes messages based on the prospect’s industry, engagement level, and potential objections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: A list of company names (prospects) and their respective fields (e.g., Engineering, Fashion, Commerce). Output: A cold email tailored to the recipient’s industry, previous engagement level, and potential objections; and an advise to you on how to further engage the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching Logic: Industry-based Personalization If the prospect is in tech, emphasize innovation. If the prospect is in finance, emphasize security & ROI. If the prospect is in healthcare, emphasize compliance & efficiency, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring (Total: 100 Marks) Chain pipeline diagram in documentation (20 Marks) – Clearly illustrate how the branching logic is structured. Ability to send the cold email (20 Marks) – Ensure the system can actually send emails. Relevance of the email to the insurance industry & the prospect’s field (40 Marks) – The messaging should feel specific and valuable to the recipient. User Experience (20 Marks) - Clarity, ease of use, and effectiveness of the system’s interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus Marks Cold Call Feature (+40 Marks): If the system can do a cold call instead of just an email (Second branch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: Look into tools like n8n for workflow automation ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would use both branching and parallel chains."
